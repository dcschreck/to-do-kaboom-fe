## To-Do KABOOM!

**About**
To-Do KABOOM! is a self destructing to-do app. If the To-Do you add isn't completed within 7 days, KABOOM! It goes away. This will allow you to stay motivated and get more things done. Enjoy!

**How to Use**
It's very straight forward. Simply type in your To-Do, hit the submit button, and you're good to go. You'll see your To-Do listed along with the number of days remaining before KABOOM!

**Specs**
This app was built with JavaScript (React) on the front-end and uses Google's Firebase database service on the back-end.
